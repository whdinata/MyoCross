# MyoCross
----------------
Using the combination of [Estimote Beacons](http://estimote.com/) and [Myo Wristband](https://www.myo.com/) we created an effective solution for visually impaired people who want to move around the city. 

After syncing the Myo Wristband with their phone, they can easily activate pedestrian light controls remotely.
